## Information
This resource is based on schneehaze’s trucking job, but his resource was not working probably and is not a real job that you can get at the Jobcenter. I decided to use his resource as a base for a perfectly working job that you can get at the Jobcenter. Currently it has just minor changes to his resource but I’m going to work a lot of it.

## Description
This resource allows you to install a Trucker Job on your Fivem ESX server. Currently it is not a real job, which you can get at the Jobcenter, but I will update it in the next few days.

## ToDo

 - Remove MissionText as requirement
 - ~~Create a “real” job~~
 - Rename the blip
 - Config
 - Realistic Truck Depot
 - Multiple Trailer Locations

## Requirements

 - ESX
 - es_extended
 - esx_jobs
 - MissionText (https://github.com/schneehaze/fivem_missiontext)

## Installation

 1. Download the resource from my github
 2. Download schneehaze’s MissionText
 3. Drag both resources into your “resources”-folder
 4. Add “start MissionText” and “start TruckerJob” in your server.cfg
 5. Import esx_truckerjob.sql into your database
 5. Start the resources/Restart your Server
